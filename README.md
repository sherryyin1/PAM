# Patch Attention-Based Deep Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification

This is the implementation of our paper by Mingjun Yin.

The proposed patch attention (PA) module that can be plugged
into original CNNs with a slight increase in parameters. The attention module
enables CNNs to focus on the feature regions that are more meaningful for image
classification, while ignoring the disturbing feature regions that have little meaning for image classification.
